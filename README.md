# The FizzBuzz Saga: A Tale of Multiples and Mirth 🎉

Greetings, brave Code Warriors! 🛡️👩‍💻👨‍💻

Your quest, should you choose to accept it, involves the mystical numbers of the FizzBuzz Kingdom. Legend has it that the numbers from 1 to 100 in this realm are no ordinary numbers. Oh no, they are enchanted with the spirits of Fizz and Buzz!

## The Rules of the Realm 📜

- **Apprentices of Fizz**: Numbers that are multiples of 3. When you encounter them, you must shout **"Fizz!"** to continue on your journey.
  
- **Disciples of Buzz**: Numbers that are multiples of 5. Upon meeting them, you must exclaim **"Buzz!"** to earn their respect.

- **The Hybrids**: Ah, but beware the rare and powerful hybrids—those multiples of both 3 and 5! These numbers are both apprentice and disciple, and you must honor them by proclaiming **"FizzBuzz!"**

## Your Mission 🚀

Your mission, noble coders, is to traverse the numbers from 1 to 100, paying your respects to Fizz, Buzz, and their hybrids as you go. Write a spell (code, for the uninitiated) to guide you through this enchanted numerical landscape.

**May the Fizz be with you, may your Buzz be ever resonant, and may you unlock the secrets of the Wizz! 🌟**

Ready? Set? Code! 🚀

## Bonus Mission: The Secret Numbers of FizzBuzz 🌟🔍

Just when you thought your quest was complete, a new challenge emerges from the depths of the FizzBuzz Kingdom! The wise Oracle of FizzBuzz reveals a hidden prophecy:

- **The Digit Masters**: Numbers that contain the digit 3 or 5 have special powers in this realm. When you encounter a number with the digit 3, you must whisper **"DigitFizz!"** to unlock its secrets.
  
- Similarly, when you come across a number with the digit 5, you must murmur **"DigitBuzz!"** to harness its energy.

Your bonus mission, should you dare to accept, is to extend your spell (code) to recognize these Secret Numbers and pay them the respect they deserve.

**Can you master this ultimate challenge and become a FizzBuzz Legend? 🌟**
